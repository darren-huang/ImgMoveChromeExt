# ImgMoveChromeExt
Chrome extension for rearranging images on https://ww4.readonepiece.com/ 
My first Chrome Extension! This is a utility for reading manga on https://ww4.readonepiece.com/. The scans of the pages are very clean on this website
but the main issue is some scenes have artwork spanning two pages and the website doesn't allow you to view them side by side. This extension
allows for easy viewing of those pages!

# How to use:
1. go to https://ww4.readonepiece.com/ and pick a chapter
1. press `Alt+W` to activate the page picker (press `Alt+Q` to exit out of this mode) or alternatively you can click the extention icon on the top right
1. click on the page you would like to be viewed side-by-side with the next page

This made use of Chrome's debugging api, allowing for very intuitive page selection~~~

Enjoy!
